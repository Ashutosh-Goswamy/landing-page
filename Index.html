              <h5 class="card-title">Draken</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Draken is a muscular teenager who is exceptionally tall for his age. His head is shaven on the sides and back to expose his signature dragon tattoo on his left temple. His blonde hair is long on the top of his head and kept in a neat braid. He leaves a few strands of hair loose in the front. <br>

              He is confirmed to be quite lean and has chiseled abdominal muscles. Takemichi remarked that his body does not seem like that of a teenager. Draken has a scar on the left side of his abdomen after being stabbed. He wears the standard Toman Toppoku while with the gang, and his favorite casual outfit seems to be a patterned long jacket.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Kazhutora</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Kazutora is of average height and has a lean frame. His natural black hair is styled in a messy wolf cut with yellow streaks throughout. He has a beauty mark under the right side of his sandy-colored eyes and a tiger tattoo extending from his neck to his shoulder and chest. Kazutora also wears a drop earring with a bell ornament at its tip. He is commonly seen wearing Valhalla's standard uniform. On days when he is not on gang duty, he wears the Mizo Middle School uniform.
<br>
                As an adult, Kazutora has significantly longer hair reaching his shoulders. His locks are predominantly black with cascading pieces dyed yellow; he often puts it up in a ponytail.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Mickey</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Mikey is a teenager of below-average height with pitch-black piercing eyes and long blonde hair that is only tied at the top with the hair on the sides moving freely.
<br>
                In the original timeline, adult Mikey's hair was slicked back, and he still had his CB250T motorcycle.
                <br>
                In his second appearance as an adult, Mikey appears with short black hair and a dragon tattoo on his neck similar to the ones Draken and Takashi Mitsuya have. He rides a CB205T owned previously by his brother, Shinichiro Sano. [6]
                <br>
                In the latest present timeline, he has short white hair with a middle part undercut hairstyle and a Bonten tattoo on his nape with a design similar to his adoptive brother's, Izana Kurokawa's, earrings. He is noted to be thinner, deranged, and with heavy bags under his eyes.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">Takashi</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Takashi Mitsuya is a young man with downturned lavender eyes, short silver-lilac hair, and a muscular body. He has a concealed dragon tattoo identical to Ken Ryuguji's on his right temple and a black huggie earring in a cross design on his left ear. When not on gang duty, he wears a variety of casual outfits or the mandatory school uniform. When he was a member of Tokyo Manji Gang, Mitsuya was most often seen wearing its uniform with the white sash. <br>
              In high school, Mitsuya has longer hair styled in a mullet. He layers a white shirt over a black long-sleeved garment for his casual outfit. He would later style his hair in a sidecut combed to the right, allowing his dragon tattoo to show on the side of his head.</p>
